      <h2>Ghanaian MPs reintroduce controversial anti-LGBT bill</h2>
      <p><br>

A group of Ghanaian MPs has reintroduced a controversial anti-LGBT bill that would impose harsh prison sentences on LGBT people and advocates, despite widespread criticism from human rights groups and concerns about major economic fallout. The bill had previously passed parliament but lapsed when the former president declined to sign it before leaving office. Its future remains uncertain, as the new parliament must decide whether to consider it again. Supporters claim it protects Ghanaian values, while activists and international organizations warn it threatens human rights, safety, and billions in potential development funding.
