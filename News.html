      <h2>Not inclined to monitor every incident of hate speech: Supreme Court</h2>
      <p><br>
India | 25 November 2025 | The Hindu (Subscription Required) | <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/not-inclined-to-monitor-every-incident-of-hate-speech-supreme-court/article70322804.ece" target="_blank" class="footer-link">Article Link</a><br><br>
On November 25, 2025, the Supreme Court of India stated it would not legislate or monitor every instance of hate speech, emphasizing that police stations, high courts, and existing laws are sufficient to address such issues. The remarks came during a hearing on alleged calls for the social and economic boycott of a minority community, with the bench urging the applicant to seek relief through state-level legal channels. While the case did not specifically mention LGBTQ+ rights, the broader implications of the Court’s stance on hate speech and selective public interest could affect marginalized groups, including LGBTQ+ communities, especially if calls for boycott or discrimination go unaddressed by local authorities. The Court will revisit the matter on December 9.</p>
      
      <h2>Ghanaian MPs reintroduce controversial anti-LGBT bill</h2>
      <p><br>
Ghana | 3 March 2025 | BBC | <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdjy91gr48lo" target="_blank" class="footer-link">Article Link</a><br><br>
A group of Ghanaian MPs has reintroduced a controversial anti-LGBT bill that would impose harsh prison sentences on LGBT people and advocates, despite widespread criticism from human rights groups and concerns about major economic fallout. The bill had previously passed parliament but lapsed when the former president declined to sign it before leaving office. Its future remains uncertain, as the new parliament must decide whether to consider it again. Supporters claim it protects Ghanaian values, while activists and international organizations warn it threatens human rights, safety, and billions in potential development funding.</p>
