      <p><br>
29 November 2025 | Japan Today | <a href="https://japantoday.com/category/national/update1-japan-high-court-rules-same-sex-marriage-ban-constitutional" target="_blank" class="footer-link">Article Link</a><br><br>
The Tokyo High Court has ruled that Japan’s ban on same-sex marriage is constitutional, making it the only high court to uphold the government’s position among six similar lawsuits nationwide. While earlier rulings in Sapporo, Nagoya, Osaka, Fukuoka, and another Tokyo court recognized that denying marriage equality violates constitutional rights, this decision emphasized a narrow interpretation of “husband and wife” as a man and woman, and excluded same-sex couples from Article 24’s guarantee of marriage freedom. Eight LGBTQ+ plaintiffs argued that the ban violates equality and the right to marry, but their claims for damages were rejected. The court acknowledged stalled parliamentary debate could eventually breach equality protections, highlighting the urgency of legislative action. With Japan remaining the only G7 nation without legal recognition of same-sex marriage or civil unions, the ruling underscores the ongoing struggle of LGBTQ+ communities for equal rights and the hope that the Supreme Court’s upcoming decision may finally unify the legal stance on marriage equality.

The European Court of Justice has ruled that Poland must recognize same-sex marriages lawfully registered in other EU countries, affirming the rights of LGBTQ+ couples to freedom of movement and family life across the Union. The case, involving a Polish couple married in Berlin, highlights ongoing tensions as Poland and some neighboring states resist marriage equality, while pro-European leaders and advocates celebrate the decision as a historic step toward greater inclusivity and recognition of LGBTQ+ rights within Europe.

      <p><br>
25 November 2025 | The Hindu (Subscription Required) | <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/not-inclined-to-monitor-every-incident-of-hate-speech-supreme-court/article70322804.ece" target="_blank" class="footer-link">Article Link</a><br><br>
On November 25, 2025, the Supreme Court of India stated it would not legislate or monitor every instance of hate speech, emphasizing that police stations, high courts, and existing laws are sufficient to address such issues. The remarks came during a hearing on alleged calls for the social and economic boycott of a minority community, with the bench urging the applicant to seek relief through state-level legal channels. While the case did not specifically mention LGBTQ+ rights, the broader implications of the Court’s stance on hate speech and selective public interest could affect marginalized groups, including LGBTQ+ communities, especially if calls for boycott or discrimination go unaddressed by local authorities. The Court will revisit the matter on December 9.</p>

      <p><br>
24 November 2025 | Ghanaian Times | <a href="https://ghanaiantimes.com.gh/university-of-ghana-rejects-claims-of-changing-statutes-to-support-lgbt-activities/" target="_blank" class="footer-link">Article Link</a><br><br>
The University of Ghana has firmly rejected claims by Moses Foh-Amoaning that it altered its statutes to endorse LGBTQ+ activities, calling the allegations “false, misleading and defamatory.” The institution clarified that its 2024 statute revisions only replaced gendered pronouns like “he” and “she” with gender-neutral terms such as “they” and “their,” a move aligned with modern English usage and not intended as support for LGBTQ+ rights. While the University emphasized adherence to Ghanaian law and governance, the controversy underscores how even small steps toward inclusive language are misrepresented as pro-LGBTQ+ reforms in a country where LGBTQ+ rights remain heavily contested. Management condemned the personal attack on the Vice-Chancellor, demanded a public apology, and warned of possible legal action, reaffirming its commitment to transparency and academic integrity while distancing itself from unfounded claims about LGBTQ+ inclusion.</p>

      <p><br>
24 November 2025 | Pink News | <a href="https://www.thepinknews.com/2025/11/24/nhs-puberty-blocker-trial-intrusive-criticism/" target="_blank" class="footer-link">Article Link</a><br><br>
The NHS has launched a controversial £10 million Pathways trial requiring trans youth under 16 to undergo 13½ hours of medical assessments, 50 forms, and invasive examinations before accessing puberty blockers—the only route to treatment after the government’s effective ban. While researchers say the study will examine wellbeing outcomes, LGBTQ+ advocates and parents argue it is intrusive, distressing, and rooted in stigma rather than care, warning it places unbearable pressure on already vulnerable trans teenagers. Critics highlight that denying puberty blockers has led to severe mental health consequences, including depression, anxiety, and suicidal despair, with campaigners calling the trial “cruelty” rather than healthcare. Advocacy groups stress that trans rights and dignity are being undermined, noting that the Cass Review—used to justify the ban—was itself criticized internationally for lacking expertise and perpetuating bias against trans and gender-diverse people. This trial, they argue, risks worsening the systemic barriers LGBTQ+ youth already face in accessing affirming healthcare.</p>

      <p><br>
20 November 2025 | the Washington Post | <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/11/20/dominican-republic-court-gay-sex-police-armed-forces/a5f41008-c644-11f0-be23-3ccb704f61ac_story.html" target="_blank" class="footer-link">Article Link</a><br><br>
The Constitutional Court of the Dominican Republic has struck down a ban that criminalized same-sex conduct within the police and armed forces, a landmark ruling hailed by LGBTQ+ advocates as long overdue. For decades, LGBTQ+ officers faced prison sentences simply for their identity, living in fear of punishment, but the court’s decision affirms their right to serve without discrimination. Human rights groups, including Human Rights Watch, praised the ruling as aligning with international standards and advancing equality, noting similar progress in Peru, Ecuador, and Venezuela. While activists celebrated this step toward inclusion, conservative voices in the country criticized it as a threat to “morality and values,” underscoring the ongoing cultural divide. Ultimately, the ruling represents a significant victory for LGBTQ+ rights in the Dominican Republic, dismantling systemic barriers and affirming that equality must extend to all members of society, including those in uniform.</p>

About 50 people gathered at the Nova Scotia legislature for a Transgender Day of Remembrance flag-raising, honouring trans lives lost to violence, discrimination, and hate. Lisa Lachance, NDP critic for 2SLGBTQIA+ affairs, called on the government to improve support for trans and gender-diverse Nova Scotians, highlighting ongoing barriers to healthcare, housing, and safety. Premier Tim Houston reaffirmed his commitment to dignity and inclusion, noting work on the province’s first 2SLGBTQIA+ Action Plan, though advocates stressed delays and rising costs of living disproportionately harm transgender and Two-Spirit communities. In Prince Edward Island, Premier Rob Lantz echoed the call for deeper understanding of systemic prejudice, urging Islanders to unite against fear and violence and to actively foster greater LGBTQ+ inclusion.</p>

<h2><img src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/twemoji/14.0.2/svg/1f1f3-1f1ff.svg" width="30">&nbsp;Puberty blockers: why politicians overriding doctors sets a dangerous precedent</h2>
      <p><br>
20 November 2025 | The Conversation | <a href="https://theconversation.com/puberty-blockers-why-politicians-overriding-doctors-sets-a-dangerous-precedent-270246" target="_blank" class="footer-link">Article Link</a><br><br>
The government’s ban on puberty blockers for gender-affirming care has been widely criticized as discriminatory and politically motivated, undermining the rights of transgender youth and their families. Puberty blockers, long recognized internationally as safe and effective, give young people time to make informed decisions about their bodies without irreversible changes, yet politicians have overridden clinical expertise by framing them as mental health treatments—a fundamental misunderstanding. While these medications remain available for conditions like precocious puberty, denying them specifically to trans youth highlights an inconsistency rooted in ideology rather than evidence. LGBTQ+ advocates, clinicians, and families stress that restricting access forces trans young people through unwanted and harmful pubertal changes, worsening mental health outcomes and violating their right to affirming healthcare. This politicization of medical care not only marginalizes trans communities but also sets a dangerous precedent where minority rights and established clinical practice are sacrificed to culture-war pressures.</p>

      <p><br>
18 November 2025 | Toronto Star | <a href="https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/alberta/alberta-invokes-notwithstanding-clause-to-stop-court-challenges-of-transgender-laws/article_1b74c350-dd88-555f-9847-4b3e5ead3cba.html" target="_blank" class="footer-link">Article Link</a><br><br>
The Alberta government has invoked the Charter’s notwithstanding clause to shield three laws that restrict transgender rights, including bans on puberty blockers and hormone therapy for youth under 16, mandatory parental notification for name and pronoun changes in schools, and prohibitions on trans women and girls competing in female sports. LGBTQ+ advocacy groups, medical associations, and community members have condemned the move as unconstitutional, harmful, and a direct attack on trans and gender-diverse people’s rights, with Egale and others vowing to continue legal challenges despite the clause. Critics argue the government is targeting a vulnerable minority and undermining democracy, while advocates like Marni Panas warn that “nobody’s rights are safe” if such measures stand. The Canadian Medical Association called the laws unprecedented political interference in evidence-based care, and local voices—including students and families—highlighted the devastating mental health impacts of anti-trans policies. This repeated use of the notwithstanding clause has sparked widespread concern that Alberta is normalizing government overreach at the expense of LGBTQ+ rights and broader human rights protections.</p>

      <p><br>
3 March 2025 | BBC | <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdjy91gr48lo" target="_blank" class="footer-link">Article Link</a><br><br>
A group of Ghanaian MPs has reintroduced a controversial anti-LGBTQ+ bill that would impose harsh prison sentences on LGBTQ+ people and advocates, despite widespread criticism from human rights groups and concerns about major economic fallout. "The bill prescribes a three-year jail term for people who identify as gay, and five to 10 years for promoters and advocates." The bill had previously passed parliament but lapsed when the former president declined to sign it before leaving office. Its future remains uncertain, as the new parliament must decide whether to consider it again. Supporters claim it protects Ghanaian values, while activists and international organizations warn it threatens human rights, safety, and billions in potential development funding.</p>
